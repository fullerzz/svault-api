# svault-api

This project is written with the intention of being used as an S3 wrapper by me. This will serve as the baseline API for how objects can be uploaded to S3 and retrieved.

## Possible Uses

- Google Drive/Cloud Storage replacement for personal files
- S3 interface for any other personal projects where I don't want to call the S3 API directly


*Overall, this is mainly for learning more about Litestar and SQLAlchemy.*
